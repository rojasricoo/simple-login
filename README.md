## Project Report: Simple Login

### Introduction

This project consists of a simple login page created using React, Vite, and some ESLint rules. The page presents a basic form for entering username and password, with links for registration and password recovery.

### Tools Used

* **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** Frontend build tool that offers a fast and efficient development environment.
* **ESLint:** Static code analysis tool that helps identify and correct style issues and potential errors in JavaScript code.

### Project Structure

The main component for the login page is located in `src/components/SimpleLogin.tsx`. The associated styles are in `src/components/styles.css`. The component is used in `src/App.tsx`, which is the entry point of the application.

### Additional Considerations

* **Functionality:** Currently, the login page is just a visual mockup. To add real login functionality, you will need to implement authentication logic and user management.
* **Security:** In a real application, it is crucial to implement appropriate security measures to protect user credentials and prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or XSS attacks.
* **Design:** The current design is basic. You can improve it by using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS, or by creating your own custom styles.

### Next Steps

* Implement authentication logic and user management.
* Improve the design and user experience.
* Add unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
* Deploy the application to a web server to make it publicly accessible.

### Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for building a complete login page. With the tools and technologies used, you can create a secure, functional, and attractive application for your users.
